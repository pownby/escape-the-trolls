# Escape The Trolls

This project is my solution to the [Reddit Daily Programmer Weekly Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4vrb8n/weekly_25_escape_the_trolls/) of the same name. I opted to write it in Angular simply as an exercise to keep my Angular skills fresh.

# Playing the game

Move your character with arrow keys or WASD. The objective is to get to the exit tile while avoiding the trolls. Your character can push a single wall, but be careful as you can make the maze impossible to solve this way!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
